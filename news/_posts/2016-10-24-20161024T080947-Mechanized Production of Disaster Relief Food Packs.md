The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) addressed one of the operational bottlenecks during disaster response through the implementation of the Mechanized Production System (MPS) of the WFP.
The Mechanized Production System will provide disaster response with efficient and organized food pack production and distribution.
The WFP said that the Philippines is the first and only country to be given a Mechanized Production System.

The MPS is capable of producing 50,000 food packs a day utilizing 100 people compared with 4,500 people packing only 15,000 food packs a day.

The first MPS was built in Pasay City on September 15, 2015.
The second was put up in Cebu City on April 26, 2016.
According to WFP, two will be in place in Clark, Pampanga and in General Santos City by 2016.

"Typhoon Haiyan showed that disasters can strike anywhere in the Philippines," said Praveen Agrawal, WFP Philippines' Representative and Country Director.
"The inauguration of the Visayas disaster response centre is a significant step towards decentralizing the Philippine government's emergency response. With help from our donors, WFP will continue to support the Philippines by establishing respective DRCs in Luzon and Mindanao."

The WFP Mechanized Production System is funded by the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom.
