July 1, 2016

Upon my assumption today I have ordered a reorganization of senior officers occupying key positions in the PNP Command Group, Directorial Staff, Regional Police Offices and National Support Units.

This reorganization followed the time-honored tradition in the police service that recognizes merit, seniority and competence in the selection process.

I have designated three of my respected upperclassmen to compose the members of my Command Group because I know fully well that I will need their expertise in command management.

A newly reorganized Directorial Staff has been constituted to assist the Command Group in operational management of the different functions and activities of the PNP.

Some Regional Directors, meanwhile, had to be reassigned to other equally-important positions in different levels of command.

I urge the entire 170,000 strong officers, men and women of the PNP to rally behind the newly reorganized Team PNP.

Thank you.
