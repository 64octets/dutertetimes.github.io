The term "Vin d’Honneur" means “wine of honor".
The French practice traditionally takes place at the end of inaugurations, speeches, and ceremonies that marks the social life of French provinces.
The tradition of celebration was adopted by the United States of America from the British tradition of holding a New Year's Day Levee.
During the American Colonial Period, it was adopted in the Philippines and always took place on the first of January.
The annual New Year's reception was quite the social event for high government officials, former presidential families, members of Congress, Judiciary, the Diplomatic Corps, business and social circles.
The event is later known as the "Vin d’Honneur" from the administration of late president Corazon C. Aquino.
Over the years, it has come to be considered primarily a diplomatic event highlighted by a toast between the President and the Papal Nuncio.

###### Papal Nuncio

Nuncio or Papal Nuncio (Apostolic nuncio) is the title for an ecclesiastical diplomat, being an envoy or permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or international organization.
A nuncio is appointed by the Holy See, which is usually an archbishop, and is the head of the diplomatic mission (Apostolic Nunciature), which is the equivalent of an embassy.

###### Diplomatic Corps

The diplomatic corps is the collective body of foreign diplomats which may refer to ambassadors, high commissioners, and others, who represent their countries in another state or country.
The term is sometimes confused with the collective body of diplomats from a particular country—the proper term for which is diplomatic service.
In some countries, the longest-serving ambassador to a country is given the title Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and is sometimes accorded a high position in the order of precedence.
